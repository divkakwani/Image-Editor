Image-Editor
============

DIPDIV's Image editor for editing 24 bpp bmp files.

Place your 24 bits per pixel(bpp) bmp image in the same directory as that of executable and enter the name along with the extension in the console.<br>
It creates a seperate bmp image file, named output.bmp (24bpp).<br>

It can perform following operations :<br>

1 Convert image into grayscale<br>
2 Convert into negative<br>
3 Crop the image<br>
4 Increase or decrease the brightness of image<br>
5 Resize the image<br>
6 Add contrast<br>
7 Pixelate the image<br>
8 Boost the color<br>


The algorithms used are not the standard ones. Any improvement or new feature suggestion will be highly appreciated.
